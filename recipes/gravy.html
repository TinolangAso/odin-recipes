<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>

        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1 quart cold chicken stock, or more if needed</li>

        <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>

        <li>salt and ground white pepper to taste</li>

        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Gradually whisk in flour, reduce heat to low,
        and stir until the roux has turned golden and smells like a cooked pie crust, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>

        <li>Whisk in about 2 cups of cold stock, a little at a time, stirring to remove any lumps. Add remaining 2 cups stock.</li>

        <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until gravy is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>Stir in heavy cream, and season with salt, white pepper, and cayenne. Taste and if the gravy still tastes
        starchy, let it simmer a little longer, adding more cold stock if necessary.</li>

        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
